        Narendra Modi
        <hr>
        Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education.
        <br>
         He was introduced to the RSS at age eight.
         <p> He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. 
          At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after.

           He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since.
         Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged.

          Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. 
          The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.
